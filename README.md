# DataFestAfrica Hackathon 2024: Improving Academic Outcomes For Secondary Education

## 🎯 Project Brief
### Project Title:
**Building a Data-Driven Solution for Laurel High School**

### Description
This project aims to improve academic outcomes for students in secondary education by building a comprehensive data-driven solution. The solution involves developing methods for data collection, structuring, and analysis to identify critical factors affecting student performance. It also includes building predictive models to assess student performance and offering actionable insights for school administrators and stakeholders.

### Project Objective:
To enhance students' academic performance at Laurel High School by leveraging data-driven insights to address educational challenges such as teacher availability, infrastructure quality, and student performance patterns.

### Problem Statement:
The quality of education at Laurel High has faced several challenges that hinder students' ability to perform well in national exams such as JAMB and WASSCE. These challenges include the unavailability of qualified teachers, poor infrastructure, lack of adequate learning resources, and insufficient support for students and teaching staff. This has resulted in below-average academic performance and decreased student engagement.

### Goals:
1. **Identify Areas of Improvement**: Analyze key factors impacting student outcomes at Laurel High School.
2. **Build a Predictive Model**: Use machine learning models to predict which students are at risk of failing and identify contributing factors.
3. **Provide Recommendations**: Create a strategic action plan for school administrators to improve student outcomes.
4. **Visualize and Communicate**: Develop interactive dashboards to communicate findings effectively.

## 📄 File Descriptions

- `data/`: Contains generated CSV files for students, parents, and teachers.
- `scripts/`: Holds the scripts for data generation and feature engineering.
- `analysis/`: Source code for data analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for modelling.

---

## 📊 Results and Findings
1. **Identified Key Factors**: Highlighted that parental engagement, teacher qualifications,test_scores, exam_scores are strong predictors of student success.
2. **Built Predictive Models**: Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost with an accuracy of up to 100% for the `Pass/Fail` prediction.
3. **SHAP Analysis**: Used SHAP values to interpret the contribution of features to model predictions, showing that `Study Hours`, `Teacher Experience`, and `Parental Involvement` have significant impacts.
